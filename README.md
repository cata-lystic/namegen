# namegen
Namegen lets you add multiple groups of words and randomize one word from each between them. It can lead to funny names or sentences. You can customize the generated word's font, color, size, rotation, etc. A screenshot feature is available to save generated words you create. It really doesn't make sense so I'll add pictures later.

Script host can set defaults for all settings. I'll add instructions for that later too.

Generate a name using your own words. If that makes sense. It's for fun, don't consider this a useful tool :)
